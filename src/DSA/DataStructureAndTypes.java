        //Data Structures
        It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

        //Types of Data Structure

        1)Linear data structure

        a)elements are arranged in sequence one after the other.therefor easy to implement
        b)Not recommended when complexity of program incr. because of operational complexities.
        c)Popular linear data structures are:
        ca) Array Data Structure:
        elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory
        All the elements of an array are of the same type
        cb) Stack Data Structure
        In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle.
        That is, the last element stored in a stack will be removed first.
        cc)  Queue Data Structure
        Unlike stack, the queue data structure works in the FIFO principle
        where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.
        cd) Linked List Data Structure
        In linked list data structure, data elements are connected through a series of nodes.
        And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node.


        2)Non-linear data structure

        a)elements in non-linear data structures are not in any sequence
        b)they are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements
        c)Popular Non-linear data structures are:
        ca) Graph Data Structure:
        In graph data structure, each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.
        cb) Trees Data Structure:
        A tree is also a collection of vertices and edges.
        However, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.
