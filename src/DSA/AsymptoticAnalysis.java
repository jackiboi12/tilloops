        Asymptotic Analysis
        The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as asymptotic analysis.

        Asymptotic Notations:
        Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm
        when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.
        There are mainly three asymptotic notations:
        1)Big-O notation
        2)Omega notation
        3)Theta notation
